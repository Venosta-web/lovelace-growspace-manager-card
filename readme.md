## Plant Attributes

Each plant entity should have:

- `plant_id` (UUID)
- `strain` (string)
- `phenotype` (string)
- `veg_start`, `flower_start`, `dry_start`, `cure_start` (ISO date strings)
- `row`, `col` (number)
- `stage` (union: `'veg' | 'flower' | 'dry' | 'cure'`)

---

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build & Deploy

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

- `build` compiles TypeScript and bundles the card.
- `deploy` copies the output to Home Assistant `www` folder.

### TypeScript & Lit Tips

- Use `PlantStage` union type to track stages consistently.
- Always use `Home Assistant` timezone via Luxon for date/time handling.
- Drag-and-drop is supported using native HTML5 events.
